  "FindingName": "Dangerous Default Permissions",
  "Description": "Dangerous default configuration settings were found in the Tenant. By default, Azure tenants allow all users to access the Entra ID blade, to read all other users' accounts, create groups, and invite guests. These default settings extend to guest accounts as well, allowing guests to perform these same actions. Other default configurations allow for Self-Service creation of accounts from accepted mail domains.",
  "Remediation": "The excessive user permissions can be mitigated by running the listed PowerShell commands as a Global Admin. User access to the Entra ID blade can be restricted by navigating to the Entra ID blade &rarr; User Settings and toggling the 'Restrict access to Entra ID administration portal' to Yes. Guest invites may be restricted by navigating to the Entra ID blade &rarr; External Identities &rarr; External Collaboration Settings, or by going to the Entra ID blade &rarr; User Settings &rarr; Manage external collaboration settings and toggling 'Members can invite' and 'Guests can invite' to No.",
